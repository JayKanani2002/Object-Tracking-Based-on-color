# Object-Tracking-Based-on-color
The "Object Tracking Based on Color" project focuses on real-time video analysis, where a user selects an object by specifying its color, and the system tracks and follows that object throughout the video stream, utilizing color-based segmentation and motion tracking algorithms for applications such as surveillance and robotics.
